 * This code to be revisited to see if all that was needed is the single scheduled
 * queue, implicitly making actions immediate by giving them an execution
 * time of "now". It would force having a sequence number to all actions, one 
 * which the queue would have to set from its (monotonic, thread-safe) counter
 * on every submission, with a modified comparison operator. This would guarantee
