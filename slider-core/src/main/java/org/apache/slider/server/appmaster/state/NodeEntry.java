/**
 * Information about the state of a role on a specific node instance.
 * No fields are synchronized; sync on the instance to work with it
 *
 The two fields `releasing` and `requested` are used to track the ongoing
 state of YARN requests; they do not need to be persisted across stop/start
 cycles. They may be relevant across AM restart, but without other data
 structures in the AM, not enough to track what the AM was up to before
 it was restarted. The strategy will be to ignore unexpected allocation
 responses (which may come from pre-restart) requests, while treating
 unexpected container release responses as failures.

 The `active` counter is only decremented after a container release response
 has been received.
 
 Accesses are synchronized.
